1. Solve the equation x2+10x+25 = 0  - x = (-b+-Sqrt(b2-4ac))/2a

2. A car is moving at a speed of 1000m/s at an acceleration of 25m/s/s
Find the time it will take to move a distance of 5km
Hint - acceleration = speed/time
speed = distance/time

3. A person has four option of choosing between;
pizza, chicken, pancakes or cake. If they choose pizza, they'll go to pizza hut,
if chicken, they'll go to kfc, if pancakes, they'll go to foodhub,

-a program using an if statement that captures the persons choice and prints the
selected restaurant

3a. -same program using a when statement

4. Solve the equation x3+7x2+10x = 0 - x = (-b+-Sqrt(b2-4ac))/2a

5. A person is moving to his village with a car moving at 20km/h and He has many
alternative routes.
If he uses route1, he'll move a distance of 5000km
If he uses route2, he'll move a distance of 25000km
If he uses route3, he'll move a distance of 50000km
If he uses another, he'll move a distance of 10000km

Find the time it will take him to reach the village using the separate routes
